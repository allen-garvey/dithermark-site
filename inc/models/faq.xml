    <faq id="opening-large-images">
        <question>Why does my browser crash when opening an image?</question>
        <answer>Opening very large images on mobile devices has been found to crash the browser. Make sure the 'Shrink large images' option is checked in the 'settings' tab. If this still does not help, try opening a smaller image, such as by selected 'Random image' from the 'open' tab, and then pixelate the image by selecting the option in the 'image' tab (this has the same effect as shrinking the image). Now try reopening the image that caused your browser to crash.</answer>

    <faq id="webgl">
        <question>Should I enable WebGL?</question>
        <answer>WebGL is enabled by default as it leverages the power of your GPU to complete tasks 30-100 times faster. Dithermark uses WebGL (when enabled) for everything except the error propogation dithers and optimize palette functionality. The only times when it might be advisable to disable WebGL is if you are noticing a large amount of artifacts in the random dithers, or you are opening images that are too large to fit in a single WebGL texture unit (you will see a warning if this is the case). If you do not see an option to enable WebGL, that means your device/browser doesn't support it. In that case do not worry, as everything will still work, it will just be slower than if your device supported WebGL.</answer>

    <faq id="export-file-types">
        <question>What file type should I use when exporting an image?</question>
        <answer>It is recommended you use the png file type when exporting your images, as it avoids <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art#Saving_and_compression">undesirable compression artifacts.</a> However, in certain situations (such as when exporting a large, unpixelated image or using post dither image filters), exporting as a jpeg may result in a smaller file in exchange for a negligible loss in quality.</answer>
